Hey there!

Here is an short explanation of the economy changes we made for v0.1.5.3.

- Spawner's can now be upgraded up to level 15.
- All spawner prices and spawner upgrade prices have been increased (alot).
- All sell prices for a variety of ores have been decreased.
- All buy prices for a variety of ores have been increased.

Due to the amount of work we have only ran extensive calculations for the villager spawner.
Therefore, keep in mind that the prices for other ore's might be slightly low or high.
The other economy aspects will be revised in the near future.

- There now is a limit of 10 mobspawners per island. 
  (regardless of how many members this island has, the maximum is 10)
- The afk time limit now exists of 3 hours maximum.

NOTE: You can still buy as many spawners as you like, you just can't place more than 10.
      This limit includes animal spawners as well.

In this update we're also going to run a pilot (tryout) on allowing AFK machine's.
Though, we don't want to see for example three players afk on the same island, in the same afk machine. 
(We don't judge or care about your preferences, but that just sounds kinda gay anyway.)

- Multiple afk machine's on a single island IS allowed, though these MUST be at least 40 blocks apart from each other.
  (If this condition isn't met, a moderator has permission to (re)move the entire afk machine. 
   You'll also receive a disciplinary warning.)
   
  
Known issue's: 
- Upgrading your spawner from level 14 to level 15, sometime's simply isn't possible because of an plugin error.
Temporary solution:
- You can upgrade your level 14 spawner to level 15 using a significantly discounted EXP level price.
